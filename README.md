**Go**ldi: **l**azy **d**ependency **i**njection framework for go.

**Note: This library is at the very early stages of its development.**

This library enables you to build your applications based on a dependency injection container.
It helps to make your code modular, flexible and ensures that you can reuse components easily.

If you are familiar with the [Symfony][5] dependency injection framework you should feel at home here.

## The goldi API
Use `go get` to get the goldi API:
```
$ go get github.com/fgrosse/goldi
```

No additional dependencies are required to use the library.

### Usage
First you need to define the types you are going to use later

```go
// create a new container when your application loads
registry := goldi.NewTypeRegistry()
config := map[string]interface{}{
    "some_parameter": "Hello World",
    "timeout": 42.7,
}
container := goldi.NewContainer(registry, config)

// now define the types you want to build using the di container
container.RegisterType("logger", NewSimpleLogger)
container.RegisterType("acme_corp.mailer", NewAwesomeMailer, "first argument", "%some_parameter%")
container.RegisterType("renderer", NewRenderer, "@logger")

// once you are done registering all your types you should probably validate the container
validator := goldi.NewContainerValidator()
err := validator.Validate(container)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

// whoever has access to the container can request these types now
logger := container.Get("logger").(LoggerInterface)

// in the tests you might want to exchange the registered types with mocks or other implementations
container.RegisterType("logger", NewNullLogger)
```

The types are build lazily. This means that the `logger` will only be created when you ask the container for it the first time. Also all built types are singletons. This means that if you call `container.Get("typeID")`two times you will always get the same instance of whatever `typeID` stands for.

More detailed usage examples and a list of features will be available eventually.

## The goldigen binary

If you are used to frameworks like Symfony you might want to define your types in an easy to maintain yaml file.
You can do this using goldigen.

Use `go get` to install the goldigen binary:
```
$ go get github.com/fgrosse/goldi/goldigen
```
Goldigen depends on [gopkg.in/yaml.v2][4] for the parsing of the yaml files and [Kingpin][6] for the command line flag parsing.

You then need to define your types like this:

```yaml
types:
    logger:
        package: github.com/fgrosse/goldi-example/lib
        type: Logger                # Currently this does only serve a documentary purpose
        factory: NewSimpleLogger

    my_fancy.client:
        package: github.com/fgrosse/goldi-example/lib
        type: Client
        factory: NewDefaultClient
        arguments:
            - "%client_base_url%"   #  As in the API you can use parameters here

    time.clock:
        package: github.com/fgrosse/goldi-example/lib
        type: Clock
        factory: NewSystemClock
```

Now you have your type configuration file you can use goldigen like this:

```
$ goldigen --in config/types.yml --out lib/dependency_injection.go --package lib
```

This will generate the following output and write it to `lib/dependency_injection.go`:

```go
package lib

import (
	"github.com/fgrosse/goldi"
)

// RegisterTypes registers all types that have been defined in the file "types.yml"
//
// DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE: it has been generated by goldigen v0.1.0.
// It is however good practice to put this file under version control.
// See https://github.com/FGrosse/goldi for what is going on here.
func RegisterTypes(types goldi.TypeRegistry) {
	types.RegisterType("logger", NewSimpleLogger)
	types.RegisterType("my_fancy.client", NewDefaultClient, "%client_base_url%")
	types.RegisterType("time.clock", NewSystemClock)
}
```

For a full list of goldigens flags and parameters try

```
$ goldigen --help
```

Now all you need to to is to create the di container as you would just using the goldi API and then somewhere in the bootstrapping of your application call

```go
RegisterTypes(container)
```

If you have a serious error in your type registration (like returning more than one result from your type factory method) goldi will panic.

Note that using goldigen and the necessary `go generate` is completely optional. If you do not like the idea of having an extra build step for your application you can still use goldis API.

## Source Code Documentation

A generated documentation is available at [godoc.org][3]

## Running the tests

Goldi uses the awesome [ginkgo][1] framework for its tests.
If you want to run the tests you need to go get [ginkgo][1] and [gomega][2]
You can execute the tests running:
```
$ go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
$ go get github.com/onsi/gomega
$ ginkgo tests
```

If you prefer to use `go test` directly you can either switch into the `./tests` directory and run it there or
run the following from the repository root directory:
```
$ go test ./tests
```

## Contributing

Any contributions are always welcome (use pull requests).
For each pull request make sure that you covered your changes and additions with ginkgo tests. If you are unsure how
to write those just drop me a message.

Please keep in mind that I might not always be able to respond immediately but I usually try to react within the week â˜º.
